    "### A small tangent on datasetgen\n",
    "So... after a lot of finagling with datasetgen.py, I have realized that it is most certianly the case that the code runs slower due to needing to run 500000 paths before it can synch back up again, causing great slowdown, espeicaly with larger batch/path numbers. However, this does not prevent us from running multiple different processes of the same code, filling up the gpu with power of more processes instead. Though there is some slowdown caused by having more processes, there is an almost 2 times improvement over runnign one process of the code when using 3 processes. Thats a lot! Of course, if you can get more processes runnign without gpu's memory going to 100% and locking up the program for extended periods of time, this should allow for as much speedup as you would get by using all of your gpu???? I think???? Ive been runnign datasetgen in its own power shells to prevent restarts of vs code from restarting it (pylance keeps crashing >:( ), but this can obviously be turned all into a single program that creates as many processes as you want! Therefore there is also datasetgen_multi.py which can do exactly that! its a slight modification of datasetgen.py but is a big quality of life update, greatly lowering the amount of power shells i need to open every time i run the program (u cant close em while they are runnign since they are locked in and dont like to stop at keyboard interrupts)\n",
