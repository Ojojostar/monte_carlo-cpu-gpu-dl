# monte_carlo-cpu-gpu-dl

me trying to do the monty ~~python~~ carlo simulation.  <br>
much inspiration taken from   <br>
[This nvidia blogpost](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-python-for-exotic-option-pricing/) <br>
[and its accompanying notebooks.](https://github.com/NVIDIA/fsi-samples/tree/main/gQuant/plugins/gquant_plugin/notebooks/asian_barrier_option)   <br>
but i made a version for snowball options instead. <br>
i also liked using [this lil thingy](https://github.com/t4fita/Barrier-option-pricing/blob/main/main.py) to get a better grasp of what was happening since lets be real nvidia blo was not explaining whatever tf was going on well :pensive:  <br>
As the name suggests, I not only made a model, but also did some cpu, gpu acceleration before throwing into a deep learning model to let it predict things as well. Tried out using pytorch here so have a pytoch quickstart thing in here as well. <br> <br> <br>

me when i get thrown into a meat grinder <br> <br>
also scuse the kinda jank snow file since i prolly should have thought hmmmm lemme make a git out of this a bit sooner than i did
